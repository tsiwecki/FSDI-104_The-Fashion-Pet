FSDI 104: INTRODUCTORY JAVASCRIPT

This course presented the key concepts in computer programming using JavaScript. I learned the basic principles of how computers create models of the world by using data and how JavaScript is utilized to change the contents of an HTML page. I gained an understanding of the basics of JavaScript and how the Document Object Model (DOM) allows access to change a documentâ€™s contents while it is loaded into the browser. I also explored how events are used to trigger code. 

Through my FSDI 104 Competency Report, The Fashion Pet,  I demonstrate that I had learned the content presented in the course and at the same time validate the application of the designated skills and competencies through a practical project that shows evidence of real-life results.  

This project is ran using Visual Code Live Server
